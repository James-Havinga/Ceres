## My Object
##### The Object that I have chosen to use which will be scanned by the user is a Ceres fruit Juice Box and more specifically the Grape flavour.

## My Concept
##### The Concept of my project was to take the user through a bit of a journey through the product where I would just display some infomation about the product while making it more interesting than just looking at the information on the actualy juice box.

## How to use

### Step 1
##### Firstly you need to scan your juice box, It needs to be the Ceres grape juice 1l container (See image above). If scanning was successful you should be able to see the name of the juice above it and a little welcome message. You will also then see an option to drop grapes which is my custom trigger and if you click it you will see bunches of grapes fall from the sky. These bunches of grapes are custom objects that I imported. You can then press the arrow to move on.
